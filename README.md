# C-SAR: SAR Image Analytics & Colorization üõ∞Ô∏è

## Overview

C-SAR (Colorized Synthetic Aperture Radar) is an advanced web application that leverages deep learning to enhance and colorize SAR imagery. By combining state-of-the-art denoising techniques with intelligent colorization algorithms, C-SAR transforms raw SAR data into visually interpretable images for researchers, analysts, and remote sensing professionals.

## Key Features üåü

- **Advanced Denoising** 
  - Implements Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) architecture
  - Effectively reduces speckle noise common in SAR imagery
  - Preserves important structural details while removing artifacts

- **Intelligent Colorization**
  - CNN-based colorization model
  - Converts single-channel SAR images into natural-looking RGB
  - Context-aware color mapping based on terrain features

- **User-Friendly Interface**
  - Intuitive drag-and-drop image upload
  - Real-time processing status updates
  - Side-by-side comparison of original and processed images
  - Batch processing capabilities

   - Export processing metadata

## API Documentation üìö

The backend exposes RESTful endpoints for image processing:

- `POST /api/denoise` - Submit image for denoising
- `POST /api/colorize` - Submit image for colorization
- `GET /api/status/<job_id>` - Check processing status
