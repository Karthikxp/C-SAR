C-SAR: SAR Image Analytics & Colorization üöÄ

Overview

C-SAR is a web application designed to denoise and colorize SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images using deep learning. The platform integrates CNN-based models for image enhancement, reducing grainy noise and improving interpretability for researchers and analysts.

Features

‚úÖ Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) ‚Äì Reduces speckle noise in SAR images
‚úÖ CNN-Based Colorization ‚Äì Converts grayscale SAR images into realistic colorized versions
‚úÖ Interactive Web Interface ‚Äì Built using Next.js & Tailwind CSS
‚úÖ Fast Processing Backend ‚Äì Uses Flask & TensorFlow for model inference
‚úÖ Optimized Performance ‚Äì Reduced load times & improved UI responsiveness

Tech Stack
	‚Ä¢	Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind CSS
	‚Ä¢	Backend: Flask, TensorFlow, OpenCV
